# Simple DFT (DCT) Compression


## Overview

This scripts offers a simple implementation of using FFT for compression of 
images.

## Example

The following example yielded a 88% reduction in size compared to the original image:

Original:
![original](/samples/sample.original.jpg)

After FFT:
![new](/samples/sample.new.jpg)
